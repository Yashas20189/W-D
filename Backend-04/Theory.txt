In index.js ->

1. require express, url encode, ejs, paths of view and public
2. making variable post using let
3. 
app.get("/posts",(req,res) =>
res.render("index.ejs"); -> used to render without any data
res.render('index.ejs', { posts: posts }); -> used to render with data from index.js to index.ejs


Breakdown of req,res

request is send to /posts from user
response is send back to user from index.ejs


In index.ejs ->

1. use basic structure of html
2. uses basic symbols like <%= %> to make layout 
3. using anchor tag to redirect /posts/new to create new post


How to Index route or give initial data using express, rest, ejs?

1. write manual data in index.js (let posts = [ ] )
2. use app.get("/posts",(req,res) => to get request from user on local host:8080/posts
3. res.render('index.ejs', { posts: posts }); -> used to render with data from index.js to index.ejs
where,
index.ejs -> has layout 
posts -> has data 


How to create new route or add data?

1.app.get("/posts/new",(req,res) -> req from user at /posts/new

2. res.render("new.ejs"); -> response to user to complete filling new.ejs where it collects username and content for the post

3. After clicking Submit button data is passed to /posts 

4. app.post("/posts",(req,res)=> {
   let{username,content} = req.body;
post -> used to collect data from the body (like username,content)
get -> used to collect data from the user input (like /post/:id -> id is collected)

5. posts.push({username,content});
   res.redirect("/posts");
data is pushed to posts array
then redirects to /posts with adding data
