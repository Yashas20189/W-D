Things I learnt in Tailwind

1. need to connect to tailwind using CDN
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>

2. After adding the above link
h1 like header won't work - all of them will give same font only 

3.PostCSS or CLI -> generally not required for freshers so I am skipping but added its' Photo-03

4.Photo-04
-> It is all about Typography & Styling 
-> Need to website of tailwind to use it's parameter inside class

5.Photo-05
-> It is all about colors and spacing
-> Need to website of tailwind to use it's parameter inside class
